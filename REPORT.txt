###Part 1: Normalizing to 1NF
Process: 1.start by creating a table Parks_Info to store park information, including park names and associated facilities.
2.insert the data into the Parks_Info table.
3.identify repeating groups (facilities) within the Parks_Info table and split them into separate tables (Parks and Facilities) to eliminate redundancy.
4.create a Parks table to store unique park names.
5.create a Facilities table to store unique facilities, linked to parks through a foreign key.
6.populate the Parks table with unique park names and the Facilities table with facility information, associating each facility with its corresponding park. 
Rationale:the process eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity by organizing data into separate tables and ensuring each table represents a single entity (park or facility), each table has a primary key and that data is atomic.
###Part 2: 2NF
Process: 1.Create Related Tables, create a ParkFacilities table to store unique facility names.
2.add a new column ParkFacilityID to the Facilities table to reference ParkFacilities.
3.create a foreign key constraint between Facilities and ParkFacilities to ensure referential integrity.
4.update the Facilities table to set ParkFacilityID based on the corresponding FacilityID from ParkFacilities.
5.remove redundant columns,FacilityName from the Facilities table.
By separating the facility names into a separate table ParkFacilities and referencing them in the Facilities table, remove partial dependencies and ensure that each non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
